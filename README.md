# gmo_relation
Extraction of precise values of the Gell-Mann--Okubo (GMO) baryon mass relation correlator models by fitting the GMO product correlation function in combination with individual baryon correlation functions. We employ 3 variants of fit-function models, wher the GMO product correlator is fit simultaneously with the four octet baryon correlators.
